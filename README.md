# SVM-Image-classifier

The work demonstrates the image classification with both the hinge loss and the softmax loss with better explanation of the mathematics behind.<br>
For the demonstration we are using the CIFAR-10 dataset to classify the images and we compare the accuaracy for thse 2 losses and also the work demonstrates the pros and cons of these 2 different losses.<br>
To download the dataset to your local machine run the bash file on `get_datasets.sh` or you can download from the reference link in the notebook attached.<br>
Hope this work gives a great intution about SVM(Support Vector Machines) considering different losses.
